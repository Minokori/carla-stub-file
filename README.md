# Description

To enable auto-completion and hints in code editors such as **VScode**, create a `*.pyi` file. This feature is compatible with `python 3.9` and later versions.

## How to Use

copy the `carla.pyi` file to your carla installed folde, like `Python39\Lib\site-packages\carla\`.

Then you should have auto-completion & hints in your code editor. I suppose to use **VScode** and its `intellicode` plug-ins.
